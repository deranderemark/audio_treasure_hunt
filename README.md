# audio_treasure_hunt
*Template for an audio treasure hunt using an Arduino Uno and the Adafruit Mp3-Shield as well as some audio files.*

This code provides the basis for an audio treasure hunt inspired by https://www.instructables.com/Audio-Treasure-Hunt/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC1LJgOTENY .
They both use the waveshield by Adafruit which wasn't in stock when I wanted to build my version wherefore I edited the code to be compatible with the Adafruit MusicMaker Mp3 Shield instead. The code is based on the one provided by instructables but with a few changes since I didn't really like some passages about it.
